#DataForge.rbx.Dev

DISCLAIMERS!
this module is in it's beta phase and is being updated periodcially and i'll glady
take actions to requested changes to the module / package on my dev forum. i am a morely a new
to making packages and i would consider myself decently advanced. 

You're allowed to make edit's to the module on your version of it but inorder to do that
duplicate the one with the package link and then remove the package link inside the duplicated version
this module is heavly modulized and has tons of great features
